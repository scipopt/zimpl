INTRODUCTION
------------
ZIMPL is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a
problem into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program
expressed in .lp or .mps file format which can be read by a LP or MIP
solver.


COMPILING
---------
To compile Zimpl you need two additional librarys:

 - GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library 
   Version 4.1.2 or newer at http://www.swox.com/gmp
 - zlib Version 1.1.4 or newer at http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

Zimpl has not been tested with older versions of above librarys.
GMP Version 3.x will not work for sure.

If zlib.h and gmp.h and libgmp.a and libz.a are not at the usual
places you have to adapt the Makefile, see below.

On a Linux system you might succeed with just saying: make

Otherwise:

  Linux/x86 with GNU C     :  gmake COMP=gnu
  Linux/x86 with Intel C   :  gmake COMP=intel
  Tru64 with Compaq C      :  gmake COMP=compaq
  Solaris with SUN Forte C :  gmake COMP=sun
  AIX with VisualAge C     :  gmake COMP=ibm
  Windows with Cygwin/GCC  :  gmake COMP=gnu

If your configuration is not in the list or does not work,
you have to change the Makefile. Go to make/local
an add a file make.<hostname_of_your_computer>
There you can set the usual suspects like CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAG,
and so on. Example:

CPPFLAGS        +=      -I/tmp/gmp/include
LDFLAGS         +=      -L/tmp/gmp/lib

Have a look at Makefile and make/make.* to
get an idea. 

CHECKING
--------
Do a "make check" and look if it works. If not, compile again
with an added "OPT=dbg" to the gmake invocation. 


INSTALLATION
------------
Copy bin/zimpl.*.opt to wherever you like.


ALL GNULESS
-----------
if you don't have gcc and gmake etc. You can try the following.
Go to src and say "cc -O *.c -o zimpl".  


LICENSE
-------
ZIMPL is under the GNU Public License Version 2. 
See the file LICENSE for details.


LATEST VERSION
--------------
Can be found at http://www.zib.de/koch/zimpl


BUGS
----
Probably several. If you find one, send a description 
with runnable example .zpl file to koch@zib.de
(Better even, send a working fix ;-)


REMARK
------
If anything is changed in the code I would recommend recompiling
without NDEBUG and NO_MSHELL defined. This will slow down the code
considerably but will do a lot of consistency checking.
In the source code are a lot of comments starting with
/*lint ... and also a target in the Makefile.
These are for flexelint (see http://www.gimpel.com) a very good
version of lint. If you are interested in my settings used for this
project, send me an email.


THANKS 
------ 
To Armin Fügenschuh, Marc Pfetsch, Sascha Lukac, Daniel Junglas
and Tobias Achterberg for there comments and bug reports.
