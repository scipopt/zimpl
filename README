INTRODUCTION
------------
ZIMPL is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a
problem into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program
expressed in .lp or .mps file format which can be read by a LP or MIP
solver.


COMPILING
---------
On a Linux system you might succeed with just saying: make

Otherwise:

  Linux/x86 with GNU C     :  gmake COMP=gnu
  Linux/x86 with Intel C   :  gmake COMP=intel
  Tru64 with Compaq C      :  gmake COMP=compaq
  Solaris with SUN Forte C :  gmake COMP=sun
  AIX with VisualAge C     :  gmake COMP=ibm

If your configuration is not in the list or does not work,
you have to change the Makefile. Go to make/local
an add a file make.<hostname_of_your_computer>
There you can set the usual suspects like CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAG,
and so on. Have a look at Makefile and make/make.* to
get an idea. 

CHECKING
--------
Do a "make check" and look if it works. If not, compile again
with an added "OPT=dbg" to the gmake invocation. 


INSTALLATION
------------
Copy bin/zimpl.*.opt to wherever you like.


ALL GNULESS
-----------
if you don't have gcc and gmake etc. You can try the following.
Go to src and say "cc -O *.c -o zimpl".  


LICENSE
-------
ZIMPL is under the GNU Public License Version 2. 
See the file LICENSE for details.


LATEST VERSION
--------------
Can be found at http://www.zib.de/koch/zimpl


BUGS
----
Probably several. If you find one, send a description 
with runnable example .zpl file to koch@zib.de
(Better even, send a working fix ;-)


REMARK
------
If anything is changed in the code I would recommend recompiling
without NDEBUG and NO_MSHELL defined. This will slow down the code
considerably but will do a lot of consistency checking.
In the source code are a lot of comments starting with
/*lint ... and also a target in the Makefile.
These are for flexelint (see http://www.gimpel.com) a very good
version of lint. If you are interested in my settings used for this
project, send me an email.


THANKS 
------ 
To Armin Fügenschuh, Marc Pfetsch and Sascha Lukac for there comments
and bug reports.
