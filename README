INTRODUCTION
------------
ZIMPL is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a
problem into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program
expressed in .lp or .mps file format which can be read by a LP or MIP
solver.

INSTALLATION
------------
GNU Make is needed to use the makefiles. 
If gcc is installed just say "make" in zimpl/src . 
This will build the program zimpl.


SPECIAL MASCHINE DEPENDEND INSTRUCTIONS 
---------------------------------------
Compaq C Compiler on Tru64
in src/Makefile, change
CC    = cc
CFLAGS= -O3 -fast
DFLAGS= -M

Compaq C Compiler on Linux/Alpha
same as above, but CC=ccc.

Sun with Sun Workshop Compiler
in src/Makefile, change
CC    = cc
CFLAGS= -fast -xO3
DFLAGS= -xM1

ALL GNULESS
-----------
if you don't have gcc and gmake etc. You can try the following.
Go to src and say "cc -O *.c -o zimpl".  

LICENSE
-------
ZIMPL is under the GNU Public License Version 2. 
See the file LICENSE for details.

LATEST VERSION
--------------
Can be found at http://www.zib.de/koch/zimpl

BUGS
----
Probably several more. If you find one, send a description 
with runnable example .zpl file to koch@zib.de
(Better even, send a working fix ;-)

REMARK
------
If anything is changed in the code I would recommend recompiling without
NDEBUG and NO_MSHELL defined. This will slow down the code considerably but
will do a lot of consistency checking.
In the source code are a lot of comments starting with
/*lint ... and also a target in the Makefile.
These are for flexelint (see http://www.gimpel.com) a very good version of
lint. If you are interested in my settings used for this project,
send me an email.

THANKS
------
To Armin Fügenschuh and Marc Pfetsch for there comments and bug reports.
