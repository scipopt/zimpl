1.02 05.Jul 2002 Release

 - new functions FLOOR(expr) and CEIL(expr) which find the
   next integer down and up.

 - Bug fixed in MPS output that lets zimpl write BOUND lines
   for variables that are not used.

 - new flag -r that write a CPLEX branching order file (.ord).
   Two new attributes for variables: 
   "priority expr" sets the branching priority for the variable. 
   "startval expr" sets the start values for the variable

 - new function ABS(expr) that returns the absolut value of expr.

 - new function CARD(set) that computes the cardinality of a set.

 - memory leak pugged, that occured when summing over a restricted set.

 - added possiblility to initialise parameter per set element, 
   the same way as variables.

 - the row scaling factor is now also printed in the .tbl file.

 - Added "attributes" to the constraints. At the moment the following 
   are understood:
   scale : scales the constraint before writing the LP file.
      After scaling the absolut larges coefficient will be one.
   separate : Means "this constraint should be separated". 
      At the moment, such constraints are written in an "User constraint"
      section in the LP-File. But CPlex does not recognise this.      

 - "sum" is now also valid for expressions without variables.

 - Fixed error in LPF Writing Routine, that would write "Inf"
   instead of "+Inf".

 - Wrong template in read now gives an error message instead of
   an segment violation.

1.01 30.Oct 2001 Bug fix release

 - Added several missing const's to the code.

 - Unterminated string constants where not reported as errors.
   This led to very irritating behavior. Fixed.

 - Since it is possible that string type set members include spaces,
   the "real" name in the .tbl file is now surrounded by doublequotes.
   (I am not totally sure this is a good idea. Maybe I should just,
   change all spaces to underscores.)

 - It is now possible to write -x[3] in a constraint. Before
   it was neccessary to write -1*x[3].

 - Changed the field splitting for the read statement. The FS
   keyword is gone. Read now tries to do the "right" thing.
   Look at the documentation for details.

 - When writing LP-format files, one's as coefficents are 
   no longer written. This makes the files somewhat shorter.

 - -d (Debug) Option is no longer be ignored.

 - Default field separators for the read statement are 
   now <space>, <;> and <tab> (<tab> is new).

 - Fixed one minor malloc error with the include statement.

 - Removed all uses of alloca() for better AIX compatibility.

 - String valued parameters now work.
